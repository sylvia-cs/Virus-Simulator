                         Puzzle Descriptions

  Provides a PUZZLEDESCRIPTION module signature, which will be the
  signature for arguments to the MakePuzzleSolver functor that creates
  a full Puzzle module. (See puzzlesolve.ml.)

  Also provides generic functors for creating a variety of Tile and
  Maze PUZZLEDESCRIPTIONs based on a simple input.

  Puzzles have a set of states and moves that can be applied to
  deterministically change puzzle state. A neighbors function
  specifies what state is moved to depending on the current state and
  move. There is a specially designated initial state and certain
  states can be goal states. A series of moves can be executed from
  the initial state.  Functionality for depicting puzzle states is
  also provided for.  *)

       < s2; 0 if s1 = s2; +1 if s1 > s2 (consistent with
       Pervasives.compare). *)

    (* execute_moves moves -- Returns the state that would result from
       executing moves starting in the initial state *)
    val execute_moves : move list -> state

    (* print_state -- Prints a representation of the state *)
    val print_state : state -> unit

    (* draw states moves -- Graphically renders a set of states and a
       sequence of moves, where the moves, when executed starting in
       the initial state traverses the states provided; used for
       debugging *)
